# 40_yard_dash_times
predicting 40-yard dash times at the NFL scouting combine using a general linear regression model. 

The NFL combine is a yearly week-long gathering every February for all the top athletes in college football. 
During this week-long gathering athletes are put to physical and mental assessments by teams and the NFL combine organization in which they perform 
exercises such as 40-yard dash, bench press, vertical jump, broad jump, 20-yard shuttle, 3 cone drill, 
60-yard shuttle, position-specific drills, interviews, physical and injury evaluation, and drug screens. 
This event is the biggest scouting day of the year and athletes spend December to February to prepare for this day in hopes to increase their stock and get 
drafted in an early round. 
Although some scouts suggest that performing well at the NFL combine does not lead to excellent performance in the NFL, 
it is clear that the attributes desired in a player can be well evaluated at the NFL combine.
